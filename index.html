    <h2>Rachel N. Gaines, Ph.D.</h2>
    <h3>Merging electrochemistry, catalysis, and waste valorization for chemical manufacturing</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Hi, I'm Rachel, and I electrocute other people's garbage for a living!</p>
	<p>More specifically, <span class="highlight"> I am a chemical engineer specializing in complex reaction systems</span>. I use the tools of catalysis, electrochemistry, and engineering to design practial processes for systems that, while critical in industry, are severely understudied at the benchtop scale.</p>
		<p>These non-ideal systems provide critical insights at <span class="highlight">all three scales of chemical process engineering</span> (catalysts, reactions, and reactors) that are cost-effective and scalable to industrial installations. My thesis work has garnered commercial interest from several multinational corporations and led to a successful academic follow-on grant. </p>
		<p>I have <span class="highlight">over a decade of leadership experience</span> from my roles as a research mentor and coach, where I've worked with mentees across wide ranges of age (8-25) and skill. I've served as a project and/or people manager for teams as small as 4 and as large as 31. <span class="highlight">My mentees have won state and national awards, and secured top Ph.D. program admissions and full-time industry job offers.</span></p>
